# Arabic Letters Image Classification with CNN

This project aims to classify images of Arabic letters using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow and Keras. The model is trained on a dataset of Arabic letter images and evaluates its performance using various metrics and visualizations.

## Project Overview
The primary goal of this project is to build a robust deep learning model that accurately identifies Arabic letters from images. This project demonstrates:
1. Image preprocessing and data augmentation techniques.
2. Building a CNN architecture from scratch.
3. Training the model with real-world image data.
4. Evaluating the model using accuracy metrics and confusion matrices.

## Model Architecture
The CNN model is designed with multiple convolutional and pooling layers to extract features from Arabic letters. The model architecture is as follows:
- Input Layer: Accepts 128x128 RGB images.
- Block 1:
  - Conv2D (64 filters, 3x3, ReLU)
  - MaxPooling2D
  - Dropout (0.3)
- Block 2:
  - Conv2D (128 filters, 3x3, ReLU)
  - MaxPooling2D
  - Dropout (0.3)
- Block 3:
  - Conv2D (256 filters, 3x3, ReLU)
  - Conv2D (256 filters, 3x3, ReLU)
  - MaxPooling2D
  - Dropout (0.4)
- Head (Fully Connected Layers):
  - GlobalAveragePooling2D
  - Dense (128, ReLU)
  - Dropout (0.4)
  - Output Layer: Dense (number of classes, softmax)

## Data Augmentation
To improve model generalization, the following data augmentation techniques are applied:
- Random Contrast
- Random Flip (horizontal and vertical)
- Random Rotation
- Random Translation
- Random Width

## Training and Evaluation
The model is trained using the training dataset for up to 50 epochs with:
- Optimizer: Adam (learning rate = 0.0001)
- Loss Function: Categorical Crossentropy
- Metrics: Categorical Accuracy

### Callbacks:
- EarlyStopping: Stops training if validation loss does not improve.
- ReduceLROnPlateau: Reduces learning rate when validation loss plateaus.

### Performance Metrics:
- Accuracy: Evaluates model accuracy on validation data.
- Confusion Matrix: Visualizes the model's classification performance.
- Classification Report: Displays precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Results
- Training Accuracy: Achieved high accuracy on training data.
- Validation Accuracy: Consistently good performance on validation data.
- Confusion Matrix: Analyzes the distribution of predicted and actual labels.
- Classification Report: Provides detailed performance metrics.

## Visualizations
The project provides several visualizations:
1. Learning Curves: Track loss and accuracy over epochs.
2. Confusion Matrix: Analyze prediction performance for each Arabic letter.
3. Augmented Image Samples: Demonstrate the effects of data augmentation.
